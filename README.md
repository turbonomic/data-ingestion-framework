# **Data Ingestion Framework: Open Framework for Turbonomic Platform** 
The project contains a few working examples to leverage Turbonomic Data Ingestion Framework (DIF) which enables using any telemetry or data to be defined in the Applicaiton Resource Management supply chain context

### What's Included?
This free and open source toolkit to map any data source into a Turbonomic full-stack context. In a single UI, you can analyze your applications within the context of the platforms it runs on.

Examples may include:

* JIRA tickets - how many open issues are present?
* Error rate of a web application - are failures occuring at the app layer?

### Examples

Open source examples of DIF definitions are also availble in the [Data Ingestion Framework repo](https://github.com/turbonomic/dif-example)
